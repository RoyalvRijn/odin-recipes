    <p>I've been using this blackberry pie recipe for years and have always succeeded with it! Frozen or fresh blackberries can be used. You can add more sugar if you like a sweeter filling. Serve with vanilla ice cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of fresh blackberries</li>
        <li>White sugar</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Pie crust</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Combine 3 1/2 cups of blackberries with 1/2 cup sugar and flour in a large bowl. Spoon mixture into the unbaked pie crust. Spread remaining 1/2 cup berries on top of sweetened berries. </li>
        <li>Cover with the top crust. Seal and crimp the edges, and cut vents in the top crust for steam to escape. </li>
        <li>Brush the top crust with milk and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake pie in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature of the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until filling is bubbly and crust is golden brown, an additional 20 to 25 minutes. Cool on wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
